`packageTest` is a skeleton R package for my own learnining.

I'm starting a basic R package, with [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html), testing with [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html), documentation with [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), and continuous integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/).

This may perhaps also include checking test coverage with [covr](https://github.com/jimhester/covr/) and enforcing style with [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr)

## Notes/procedure 
* I'm working in Rstudio.
* Need to use knitter to make the README.md in the package from the README.Rmd Not
sure if CONDUCT.md should be in package or root directory (or if they should be
the same).
* I'm keeping some commands in History.R

* I've got some tests in now, next up: travis! (Do I want to make devtools::document() part of the integration?)
